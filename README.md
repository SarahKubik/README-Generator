# README-Generator

## User Story

A ReadMe generator that produces a professional ReadMe.md file to be used for projects.

## Acceptance Criteria

When you run node index.js, the application uses the inquirer package to prompt you in the command line with a series of questions about about your project, contributors, and contact details.

Once the questions have been completed, the application will generate markdown and a table of contents for the README from the responses to the Inquirer prompts.

The fs.writeFile is used to generate your project's README.md file.
